The founders of Tradeblock were all sneakerheads with a common interest and a history together. Darren, Mbiyimoh and Tony felt that the online sneaker community never reflected the passions and trading that were the core of the sneaker culture.   

There was a very large cash market (e.g. StockX and GOAT) but online swapping, which normally occurred at conventions, had been trivial in relative size.  The community needed a peer-to-peer network - built and run by sneakerheads but brought forward to the digital age. Still, the end state of product market fit was unknown.

Today, Tradeblock is the world’s largest pure-play sneaker trading platform. How did Ten X Labs fit in?

**We made time** - The first thing Ten X Labs did for Tradeblock was create time.  We created time by relieving the founders of a number of back-office responsibilities in areas of legal, finance, and accounting.  These were not big, complex things but the time saved was a big deal. Most early-stage companies run out of time.

**We installed incrementalism** - Not knowing what they didn’t know, the founders concerned themselves initially with demonstrating big wins  in areas of business model improvement. Ten X the founders understand that a system of continuous improvement would not only fuel morale, it would be seen by prospective investors as highly attractive.  This was particularly important in the area of fundamental profitability (i.e. gross margins).  

>“We're offering a new and exciting approach to collecting, and as a result our member growth and community engagement has been off the charts.”

Mbiyimoh Ghogomu on community growth</cite>

**What was the outcome?** When we tallied up the above, we observed that there was both an internal result and an external result. The internal result was creation of a functioning system that would be persistent and resourceful. The external result was to the extent that seed funds are the eventual customer of Ten X, we had achieved product market fit.
