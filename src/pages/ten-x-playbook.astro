          <p>Ten X Labs conducts a no-cost, one-on-one, six week program where we explore three critical startup areas with the Founders:</p>

              header="Product/Market fit"
            >
              <p>Founders are required to research their markets and are exposed to the pitfalls of being an engineering-driven company versus one that builds in a customer-driven feedback loop from the start. We explore exactly which KPIs the company should focus on, now, and what type of management, consultant and teaming structure is needed. We work with the Founders to establish a budget and how to focus spending on the things that matter for this stage of their business.</p>

              header="Operations and Team"
            >
              <p>This one-on-one approach enables Ten X Labs Partners to observe Founders at work, exposing those attributes that have the highest probability of startup success. These include critical thinking skills, work ethic and the collaborative ability and communications skills required to create alignment across a team, both internally and externally.  All of this occurs before Ten X Labs offers our Term Sheet to any Founder.</p>

          <p>Once Ten X Labs has made its initial (Angel) investment, we will work closely with the Founder focusing on Product/Market Fit. A Ten X Labs Operating Partner will be assigned to the company and with the Founder, we will establish specific KPIs where these investment dollars will be spent to achieve results. Ideally, we want to exit this period with the following:</p>
          <Accordion>
            <AccordionItem
              header="A user-validated prototype or v1 offering"
            >
              <p>The KPIs are established prior to the Angel investment. They may reflect some objective result (e.g. number of paying users) or, more likely at this stage, a sequence of user behaviors that cumulatively provide evidence of product market fit. We are not looking for scalable revenues at this point, but rather validation that the problem exists and that this solution is a viable one.

            <AccordionItem
              header="Removal of all technical uncertainty around that offering"
            >
              <p>At this stage, we have only working theories regarding how to economically scale revenues and early hypotheses into fundamental profitability of the business (i.e. gross margins and their scalability).</p>

            <AccordionItem
              header="An evidence-based hypothesis for route to market"
            >
              <p>During this phase, Ten X Labs also works with the Founders to start mapping out the organizational roles that will be required at the next stage of their growth, and the company will have begun to recruit for those roles.</p>

          <p>If the company hits their previous KPIs, the intention is for Ten X Labs to make a follow-on Pre-Seed investment and to move the assigned Operating Partner to a Board seat. While the product spend will continue to grow during this phase, we also begin working with the Founders to build their business (as opposed to the almost maniacal focus on product during the Angel phase). To prepare the business for an outside-led Seed round, the Pre-Seed phase is focused on:</p>

            <AccordionItem
              header="Proven marketing and sales results"
            >
              <p>Again, by working with the Founders before the pre-Seed round is closed, Ten X Labs helps establish specific KPIs they need and expect to achieve. The focus is on preparing the business for an outside-led Seed round from a traditional VC.</p>

            <AccordionItem
              header="Removal of all technical uncertainty around that offering"
            >
              <p>In general, the Foundersâ€™ focus now needs to turn to Revenues and Gross Margins.</p>

            <AccordionItem
              header="An evidence-based hypothesis for route to market"
            >
              <p>The principal operating system installed is one of continuous improvement. We work with the Founders on team dynamics, their newly-defined option pool and how to think about startup compensation. Ten X Labs also continuously works with the Founders to help them become confident juggling their larger responsibilities as well as their communications with a growing network of financing alternatives.</p>
